The text discusses market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency. The company's cash equivalents and short-term investments are in money market funds and time deposits affected by prevailing interest rates. With $14.5 billion in fixed-rate debt due between 2024-2030, the fair value fluctuates with interest rate and foreign currency changes. 57% of revenue comes from currencies other than USD, posing foreign currency risk. Exchange rate fluctuations impacted revenue negatively, with a $107 million foreign exchange loss in 2023 Q1. The company does not hedge foreign currency exposure, and exchange rate volatility could significantly impact future operations due to international expansion.
