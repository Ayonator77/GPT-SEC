Investment risks include preserving capital and managing liquidity, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion.

Foreign currency risk arises from operating globally in multiple currencies, impacting revenue and expenses. The company may use derivatives in the future to hedge against foreign currency exchange risk.
