The company is exposed to currency exchange rate risks due to its global operations and uses derivative instruments to manage fluctuations. The gross notional amount of outstanding currency exchange rate derivative instruments was $15.0 billion as of July 30, 2021. A sensitivity analysis indicates that a 10% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar would impact the fair value of these contracts. The company also faces interest rate risk on short-term investments and borrowings, managing it with a focus on liquidity needs. The debt portfolio mainly consists of fixed-rate debt in U.S. dollars and Euros. A 10 basis point change in interest rates at July 30, 2021 would impact the fair value of these instruments. For further details on market risk and current market conditions, see the management's discussion and analysis and relevant notes in the financial statements.
The management, including the CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and changes in internal control over financial reporting. They concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have been no material changes in internal control over financial reporting during the period of the report, despite most employees working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued a ruling in August 2020 concerning the disclosure threshold for legal proceedings involving environmental laws where a governmental authority is involved. The company has adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million for such cases based on the belief that matters below this threshold are not material. Detailed company policies on legal proceedings can be found in the management's discussion and analysis section, with further information provided in Note 16 of the current financial statements.
