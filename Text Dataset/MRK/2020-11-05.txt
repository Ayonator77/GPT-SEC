Merck has announced plans to spin off its women's health, biosimilars, and established brands businesses into a new publicly traded company named Organon & Co., with the process expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. Despite facing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to disruptions in sales, the company remains confident in its long-term growth prospects. Revenue growth has primarily been driven by its oncology franchise, while pricing pressures and generic competition continue to impact sales performance. Key products such as Isentress/Isentress HD and Zepatier experienced significant declines in sales, and sales of diabetes medications and women's health products also saw decreases. However, there was growth in the sales of cardiovascular drugs, biosimilars, and animal health products. Cost management measures and collaborations have helped manage operating expenses, with declines in certain costs offset by increases in research and development expenses particularly due to partnerships. Additionally, the Company detailed ongoing restructuring efforts and associated costs.
