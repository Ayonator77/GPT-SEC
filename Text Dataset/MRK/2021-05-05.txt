Negative impacts on the Company's operations have been noted, especially in vaccine sales in the US, with a projected net unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on sales for the year 2021 due to the pandemic, particularly affecting the Pharmaceutical segment. Furthermore, it mentions that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Merck's business in various ways, including a $600 million negative impact on Pharmaceutical sales in the first quarter of 2021.
