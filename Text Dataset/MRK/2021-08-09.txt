In 2021, Merck completed a spin-off of its women's health, biosimilars, and established brands businesses into a new company named Organon, accompanying various business developments such as licensing agreements, collaborations, and acquisitions in biotechnology and HIV. Additionally, the company responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by discontinuing the development of a COVID-19 treatment, investing in an antiviral program, and entering agreements for the manufacturing and supply of related products. Sales growth in the oncology segment was driven by Keytruda, despite the pandemic's negative impacts and the anticipated adverse effects of global healthcare cost containment efforts on product pricing and market access. Concerning financial performance, sales of Januvia and Janumet for type 2 diabetes decreased due to pricing pressure and upcoming loss of market exclusivity in various countries, while sales of livestock and companion animal products in the Animal Health segment experienced significant growth. Costs, expenses, and restructuring activities increased during the period, and the Company's effective income tax rates were higher due to charges associated with acquisitions. Non-GAAP income and EPS measures were used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Company's performance, showing increased profits in the Pharmaceutical segment and growth in the Animal Health segment in the second quarter and first six months of 2021.

The text provided indicates that information regarding legal proceedings can be found in Note 9 of the financial statements in Part I, Item 1.
The text discusses the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on a company's business operations and financial performance. The company has experienced a negative impact on its business and financial results due to the outbreak of COVID-19, with uncertainties surrounding the spread and severity of the virus. The company expects a net unfavorable impact to sales of less than 3% in 2021 due to the pandemic, primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment. Despite continued negative impacts, the company believes that health systems and patients have largely adapted to the pandemic's effects, with investments in COVID-19 antiviral programs offsetting some financial impacts. In 2021, the company estimated a negative impact on Pharmaceutical sales of approximately $400 million for the second quarter and $1.0 billion for the first six months, while there was no impact on Animal Health sales. Operating expenses have reflected a minor positive effect as investments in COVID-19 research programs offset lower spending in other areas due to the pandemic.
The issuer made purchases of equity securities totaling 3,173,900 shares during the three months ended June 30, 2021, as part of a plan approved by the Board of Directors in 2018 to repurchase up to $10 billion of Merck's common stock for its treasury. The shares were bought at different average prices per share over the period, with an approximate dollar value of shares yet to be purchased under the program.
