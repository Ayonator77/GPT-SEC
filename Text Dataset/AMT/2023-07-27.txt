The text discusses the transition from LIBOR to SOFR as the benchmark for interest rates and the potential impact on the company's cost of financing. The decision to phase out LIBOR by June 2023 has led to changes in the company's bank facilities to transition to SOFR rates. However, there are uncertainties regarding the favorability of SOFR rates compared to LIBOR, as SOFR is an overnight secured rate and may lead to increases in interest rates on current or future debt obligations. This shift could potentially impact the company's interest expense, results of operations, and cash flows negatively.
