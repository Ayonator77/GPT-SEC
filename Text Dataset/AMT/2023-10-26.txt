The text discusses the market risks faced by a company, particularly interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. Interest rate risk pertains to fluctuations in interest charges on variable rate debt, potentially resulting in additional interest expenses. Foreign currency risk arises from changes in exchange rates for transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, with potential impacts on revenues, expenses, and debt. The company's exposure to these risks is detailed, including potential losses due to adverse changes in exchange rates, and the measures taken to mitigate these risks.
The text provided discusses disclosure controls and procedures established by a company to ensure that material information is known to relevant parties, including senior management and the Board of Directors. The management, along with the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of these controls and procedures and concluded that they were effective as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, there have been no changes in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter that are likely to materially affect their financial reporting.
The company is involved in legal proceedings that are considered incidental to its business operations. Management, after consulting with legal counsel, believes that there are currently no pending matters that would significantly impact the company's financial position, operational results, or liquidity.
