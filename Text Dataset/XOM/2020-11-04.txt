ExxonMobil is involved in legal proceedings regarding violations of the Clean Air Act at its facilities in Texas. The lawsuits by Environment Texas and the State of Texas allege unauthorized emissions events and failure to comply with reporting requirements. The U.S. District Court initially awarded civil penalties, but the Fifth Circuit later vacated the penalty and remanded the case for further proceedings. The State of Texas lawsuit seeks penalties and injunctive relief for alleged violations at ExxonMobil's Beaumont Refinery. The outcomes of these legal proceedings are pending, with potential revised decisions expected in the near future.
