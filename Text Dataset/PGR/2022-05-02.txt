Progressive Corporation's insurance subsidiaries saw an increase in premiums and policies for various lines of business in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the previous year. Despite experiencing growth in net premiums written and policies in force for Personal Lines, Commercial Lines, and Property, the company faced challenges in underwriting profitability and net income due to rising loss costs. Progressive took steps such as implementing rate increases and non-rate actions to address these challenges, with a focus on investments and customer retention. They also examined actuarial processes for adjusting reserves and underwriting expenses, including analyzing growth in net premiums written and policies in force for different lines of business.
