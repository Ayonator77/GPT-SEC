Chubb, as a global company, follows a policy of matching assets, liabilities, and required capital in local currencies, using derivatives for planned cross border transactions. The company does not hedge net asset non-U.S. dollar capital positions but engages in hedging activity for specific transactions. Chubb views its variable annuity reinsurance business as having a risk profile similar to catastrophe reinsurance, evaluating long-term economic loss probabilities. Adverse market factors and policyholder behaviors impact realized gains, net income, and underwriting income for the company's reinsurance of GMDB and GLB guarantees. The sensitivities of FVL and derivative instruments to equity and interest rate movements are provided, and the net amount at risk under different scenarios for GMDB, GLB, and combined coverages are estimated. Treaty claim limits impact the net amount at risk as equity markets fluctuate.
