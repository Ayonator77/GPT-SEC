The financial results of Boeing have been significantly impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the grounding of the 737 MAX airplane. The pandemic has caused a massive shock to air travel demand, affecting the commercial aerospace sector profoundly. Various segments of the company, particularly Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Global Services (BGS), and Defense, Space & Security (BDS), have experienced declines in revenues and earnings due to reduced traffic, delivery disruptions, and supply chain challenges linked to the virus. 

Boeing expects a multi-year recovery period for its commercial services and airlines adapting to reduced traffic levels. Slower demand for aircraft deliveries and program margins have led to losses in operations and reduced production rates to manage the supply and demand imbalance. Liquidity concerns have prompted cost-saving actions like production rate reductions and adjustments to maintain competitiveness amid uncertain global travel trends. The company has taken measures to preserve liquidity, such as deferring advances to suppliers, delivery postponements, lower spending, and cancellations.

Additionally, financial impacts include reduced cash flow from operations, financing activities adjustments, and limited capital resources due to pandemic-induced challenges. Boeing has adopted various financial measures, including debt restructuring, suspending share repurchases, and decreasing dividends. The airline industry's recovery will be crucial for Boeing's turnaround, and uncertainties persist regarding the resumption of air travel to pre-pandemic levels. 

Boeing uses core operating earnings, core operating margin, and core earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measures to assess underlying business performance. These measures exclude certain pension and postretirement benefit costs to provide investors with additional insights into operational performance amid challenging market conditions. The company continues to closely monitor developments, implement cost-saving strategies, and maintain compliance with debt covenants to navigate the uncertain business landscape impacted by the pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding.
