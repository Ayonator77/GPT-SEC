The text discusses the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a company, focusing on interest rate risk related to fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations and customer financing assets. The company has $4 billion remaining on its two-year delayed draw floating-rate term loan credit agreement as of September 30, 2021, with plans to repay it in the fourth quarter of 2021.
