During the second quarter of 2021, Citigroup reported significant growth in earnings compared to the previous year, largely due to the release of an allowance for credit loss and improvements in portfolio quality. However, revenues decreased due to normalization in market activity, lower card loans, and the impact of lower interest rates. Despite this, the company continued to invest in its transformation and returned $4.1 billion to common shareholders. Deposit growth was observed in both consumer and corporate sectors, while loans declined. The company's net income was $6.2 billion, with revenues declining by 12%.
