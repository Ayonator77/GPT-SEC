Verizon Communications Inc. is a leading global provider of communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services. In 2021, the company is focusing on expanding its customer base, enhancing ecosystems, and driving monetization through significant investments in wireless spectrum, network capacity, fiber infrastructure, and advanced technology systems. Operating in two segments – the Consumer Group and Business Group – Verizon is heavily investing in expanding its 5G network and fiber infrastructure. The company saw consolidated revenue growth in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, with increasing operating expenses attributed to investments in wireless equipment, networks, technology, and administrative expenses. While the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted their operations in 2020, the effects lessened in 2021. Verizon continues to prioritize network expansion, technological advancements, and delivering efficient and reliable services to customers. The Consumer segment experienced revenue growth in wireless services and equipment, leading to an increase in operating income and EBITDA, while the Business Group segment saw revenue increases in certain sectors like Small and Medium Business and Public Sector, offset by declines in Global Enterprise and Wholesale revenues. The varying revenue results were driven by factors such as wireless service and equipment sales, competitive pricing pressures, and growth in wireless connections. Operating expenses increased, primarily due to higher service and equipment costs, partially offset by declines in access fees.
