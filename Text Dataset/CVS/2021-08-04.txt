CVS Health Corporation is a diversified health services company operating segments including Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC, and Corporate/Other, with a focus on improving outcomes and lowering costs. Despite facing lower Medicare risk adjustment revenue and continued COVID-related costs, the company saw an increase in revenues across all segments for the six months ending June 30, 2021. However, operating income decreased due to factors such as normalized utilization levels in the Health Care Benefits segment. The Pharmacy Services segment experienced growth in revenues, operating income, and claims processed due to increased pharmacy claims volume, specialty pharmacy growth, and COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally, the Retail/LTC segment saw growth in revenues and operating income driven by increased prescriptions filled and strong performance in pharmacy and front store services. Insights into medical membership changes, Medicare updates, and generic dispensing rates were provided to contextualize the financial results.
