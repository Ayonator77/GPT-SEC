BlackRock's financial report for the first quarter of 2021 highlights that the company's assets under management (AUM) amounted to around $9.01 trillion as of March 31, 2021. The report noted significant net inflows in retail and institutional investments across various asset classes in the US and internationally, with notable increases in fixed income and equity investments. Additionally, the acquisition of Aperio Group, LLC expanded BlackRock's capabilities, contributing to its increased operating income, revenue, and earnings per diluted common share compared to the same period in 2020. Despite the positive financial results, the company cautioned that forward-looking statements in its reports are subject to risks and uncertainties that could lead to different outcomes from those anticipated, with the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the UK's exit from the EU influencing its operations. Foreign exchange movements also affected AUM due to the strengthening of the US dollar, as detailed changes in AUM by various metrics were provided in the report, including net inflows in retail and institutional investments, totaling $36.5 billion and $27.6 billion, respectively.
The text discusses market risks faced by BlackRock in terms of AUM market price risk and corporate investments portfolio risks. BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk, and foreign exchange rate risk. The company's investments in sponsored investment products, real assets, private equity, and hedge funds are subject to fluctuations in market prices. BlackRock hedges its market and interest rate exposure through a seed capital hedging program and maintains investments in consolidated sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities. The company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign exchange risk.
BlackRock evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures, concluding they were effective. There were no significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting during the quarter, nor any significant impact due to the majority of employees working remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company is continuously assessing the situation to determine any potential impact on the internal control over financial reporting.
