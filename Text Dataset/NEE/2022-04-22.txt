In late February 2022, the NRC reversed a previous decision regarding FPL's Turkey Point subsequent license renewal, stating that the generic environmental impact statement for license renewal does not apply to SLR applications. As a result, the NRC directed to amend the licenses by removing the 20-year term added by the SLR, restoring the previous expiration dates for Turkey Point Units. This decision affects not only Turkey Point but also all SLR applications nationwide, indicating that applicants must request a site-specific EIS or use a new generic EIS issued by the NRC for SLR applications. The outcome is not expected to significantly impact NEE's and FPL's operations or financial statements.
