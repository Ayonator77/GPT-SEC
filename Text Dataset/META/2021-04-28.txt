Multiple legal proceedings, including putative class actions and derivative actions, have been filed against the company and its directors and officers since March 2018, alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes in connection with the company's platform, user data practices, and data misuse by third parties.

Moreover, ongoing probes and litigation by competition authorities in the US, Europe, and elsewhere regarding the company's acquisitions and business practices could also result in monetary remedies or other equitably adverse consequences. In particular, antitrust lawsuits filed by state attorneys general and the FTC seek to enforce antitrust laws against the company, potentially resulting in divestiture or other structural changes. The company is vigorously defending these legal challenges, aiming to protect its business interests. Additionally, various other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and investigations are part of the company's regular business operations, which may also lead to potential liabilities.
The text outlines various risk factors that may impact the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the company. These risks include challenges related to product offerings, business operations, financial results, government regulation, security breaches, intellectual property, and ownership of the company's stock.

The company also faces risks in terms of building and operating technical infrastructure, maintaining accurate user metrics, managing international operations, and addressing design, manufacturing, and supply chain issues.
