The text discusses a U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute that began in 2015 when the IRS sought approximately $3.3 billion in additional tax from a company for the years 2007-2009, involving transfer pricing issues. Despite a previous agreement between the company and the IRS on tax calculation methodology, the IRS later changed it retroactively, leading to ongoing litigation.
