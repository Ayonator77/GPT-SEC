The text provides an update on a U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute that a company faced in 2015. The IRS sought an additional $3.3 billion in federal income tax for 2007-2009, reallocated income, and rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology without notice. The company initiated litigation, which resulted in a Tax Court opinion favoring the IRS but allowing offsets on dividends. The company believes the IRS misapplied regulations, and despite recording a tax reserve, it's confident its position will be sustained on appeal. The potential impact of IRS adjustments could result in significant additional liabilities and impact financial position, operations, and cash flows. The estimated total incremental tax and interest liability could be about $13 billion as of December 31, 2021, with potential annual tax rate increases in future years. The outcome is pending further court decisions, with the company currently estimating a payment of about $5 billion for the 2007-2009 tax years if the IRS prevails.
