The text states that as a requirement under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, companies need to disclose any activities related to parties subject to sanctions by OFAC in their reports. This includes activities authorized by law. The U.S. government blocked the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and issued General License No. 1B to allow U.S. companies to engage in transactions with the FSB, which must now be disclosed under the Exchange Act even if legal. The company's subsidiaries file notifications and apply for permits with the FSB to import products in Russia, which is authorized by the OFAC General License, with no direct profits from these activities.
