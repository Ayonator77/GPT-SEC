The Company is updating its previously disclosed risk factors with additional information. One new risk factor involves exclusive forum provisions in the By-laws, which may limit stockholders' ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its officials. The By-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for any internal corporate claims unless an alternative forum is selected. These provisions could discourage legal actions, increase expenses for stockholders, and potentially yield unfavorable outcomes. Challenges to the applicability or enforceability of these provisions might lead to increased litigation costs for the company and unfavorable outcomes, impacting its business, operations, and financial condition.
The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock between July 16, 2013, and October 1, 2021.

The management will determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on market conditions. The repurchased shares are to be used for equity compensation plans or other corporate purposes. As of October 1, 2021, 20 million shares were still available for repurchase. Danaher issued 71 thousand shares to employees in a private placement, totaling $23 million, during the third quarter of 2021. The Company plans to fund future stock repurchases using available cash balances or debt issuance proceeds.
