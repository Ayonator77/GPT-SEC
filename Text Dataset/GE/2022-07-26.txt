The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of General Electric Company's financial performance for the second quarter of 2022 discusses the increase in total revenues driven by growth in Aerospace and HealthCare, while Renewable Energy and Power faced declines. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding certain costs, was $0.78, with a decrease in cash used in operating activities compared to the previous year. Remaining performance obligations (RPO) in Aerospace increased due to ongoing supply chain challenges and geopolitical uncertainties. Revenues for the quarter and half-year increased, with declines in Equipment revenues offset by increases in Services revenues. Adjusted profit and margins increased organically at Aerospace and Power but decreased at Renewable Energy and HealthCare due to various factors such as inflation pressures, supply chain delays, and ongoing COVID-19 impacts. Furthermore, the analysis provided detailed financial information concerning segment revenues, profits, and various financial elements while highlighting the impacts of the wind-down of certain businesses and the Russia and Ukraine conflict. The company also maintains a disciplined financial policy focused on liquidity and announced plans to form three new public companies.
