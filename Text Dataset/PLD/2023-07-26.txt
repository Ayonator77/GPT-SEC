The text discusses the exposure of a company to market risks such as foreign exchange and interest rate variability. The company hedges its foreign currency risk through borrowing and derivative instruments, and monitors market risk through sensitivity analysis. For foreign currency risk, the company primarily hedges by borrowing in invested currencies and using derivatives. It also uses forward contracts to hedge against translation risks for earnings in different foreign currencies, with a potential $153 million cash payment if the U.S. dollar weakens by 10%. Regarding interest rate risk, the company borrows mainly with fixed rate debt and uses derivative instruments for variable rate debt. A 10% increase in interest rates on variable rate debt could lead to an additional annual interest expense of $6 million.
