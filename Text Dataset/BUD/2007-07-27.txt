The text discusses the responsibility of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer in maintaining disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely communication of material information as required by securities laws. The company's procedures include communication of events, automated accounting processes, management reviews, and internal control systems. The officers evaluated these controls as effective as of June 30, 2007, with no significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting during the quarter.
The Company is currently involved in legal proceedings with one of its cansheet suppliers, Novelis Corporation, who sought relief from its obligations under their supply agreement. The Company believes the assertions by Novelis are baseless and is vigorously defending its rights in federal court. Additionally, certain putative class action lawsuits against the Company were dismissed by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Michigan and Ohio, citing lack of standing and federal jurisdiction due to no injury pleadings and an intervening legal cause of underage drinking, making the claims not redressable in court.
