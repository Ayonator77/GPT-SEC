The text outlines the responsibility of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer in maintaining disclosure controls and procedures within a company. These controls ensure timely communication of material information requiring disclosure under securities laws. The evaluation conducted as of June 30, 2006, concludes that the company's controls are effective in providing reasonable assurance in identifying and communicating necessary information. Additionally, there were no significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting during the quarter.
The Company faced legal proceedings in 2004 when individuals sought to bring a class action lawsuit on behalf of underage California residents who purchased alcohol from the Company. Similar complaints were filed in Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, where parents sued to recover money spent by their underage children on alcohol from sources other than the defendants. The lawsuits alleged negligence, unjust enrichment, violation of sales statutes, nuisance, and more. The Company successfully had cases dismissed or transferred to federal courts and intends to vigorously defend against the remaining lawsuits. Similar actions were pursued in New York and Florida, but the Company was not served in those cases.
