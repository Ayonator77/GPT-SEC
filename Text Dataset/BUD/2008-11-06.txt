The company faced legal proceedings in various lawsuits, including litigation with Novelis Corporation which was concluded with a dismissal of all claims. Additionally, there were shareholder class actions related to the transaction with InBev N.V/S.A which were settled pending court approval. Furthermore, Grupo Modelo, S.A.B. de C.V filed for arbitration against Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. over governance rights violations in the InBev transaction, seeking remedies and damages; however, Anheuser-Busch International Holdings believed the claims to be without merit and planned to contest them vigorously.
