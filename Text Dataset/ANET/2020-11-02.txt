The company is exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and investments in privately-held companies. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased global financial market volatility, impacting foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks. While most revenue is in U.S. dollars reducing direct foreign currency risk, expenses are in various currencies, making operations subject to currency exchange fluctuations. The company's interest income sensitivity primarily affects its market risk exposure, with investments mainly in fixed-income securities. Privately-held company investments are recorded on the balance sheet, although inherent risks are associated with startups and development-stage companies.
