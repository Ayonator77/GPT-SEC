Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH), relating to health issues caused by smoking. In one particular case, RBH and other manufacturers were found liable and ordered to pay substantial damages in Canada. PMI recorded a significant charge in connection with these legal proceedings. The company disputes the findings in various lawsuits, arguing that they are not responsible for warning all smokers about the risks and that individual differences among smokers should be considered. Numerous other class action cases and health care cost recovery actions have been filed in Canadian courts against PMI, RBH, and other members of the tobacco industry. The ongoing legal battles have resulted in a high number of pending cases, with complex financial and legal consequences for the companies involved.
Philip Morris International Inc. is dedicated to transforming the tobacco industry towards a smoke-free future by producing and marketing cigarettes alongside smoke-free products and nicotine-containing items globally. The company received FDA authorization for certain products and is investing in reduced-risk products, notably highlighting their smoke-free brand, IQOS. Financially, the company saw increased revenues and earnings in the nine months ending September 30, 2021, driven by factors like volume/mix trends, pricing variances, and currency movements despite charges related to asset impairment and acquisitions. They prioritize promoting healthier alternatives to smoking, with smoke-free products and RRPs fueling revenue growth and profitability, all while navigating regulatory challenges and uncertainties, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide alternatives to adult smokers while preventing youth nicotine consumption. Collaboration agreements and legal challenges have been crucial in this effort, emphasizing the importance of science-based regulation to differentiate between harmful and potentially less harmful nicotine products.
