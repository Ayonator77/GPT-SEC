CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Review of Related Party Transactions

In accordance with the charter for the Audit Committee of the Board, our Audit Committee reviews and approves in advance any proposed related person transactions.

For purposes of these procedures, &#8220;related person&#8221; and &#8220;transaction&#8221; have the meanings contained in Item 404 of Regulation S-K.

The individuals and entities that are considered &#8220;related persons&#8221; include:

&#160;

&#8226; 

Directors and executive officers of Tesla&#59; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Any person known to be the beneficial owner of five percent or more of Tesla&#8217;s common stock (a &#8220;5% Stockholder&#8221;)&#59; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Any immediate family member, as defined in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, of a director, executive officer or 5% Stockholder. 

In accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedures, the Audit Committee must review and approve all transactions in which (i) Tesla or one of its subsidiaries is a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) a related person has a direct or indirect material interest, other than transactions available to all Tesla employees generally.

In assessing a related party transaction brought before it for approval the Audit Committee considers, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person&#8217;s interest in the transaction. The Audit Committee may then approve or disapprove the transaction in its discretion.

Any related person transaction will be disclosed in the applicable SEC filing as required by the rules of the SEC.

Other Transactions

&#160;

Tesla periodically does business with certain entities its directors are affiliated with Such transactions are done on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances . 

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into offer letters with our executive officers. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers. The indemnification agreements and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In relation to our CEO&#8217;s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 to indemnify the Company for additional taxes owed, if any . 

&#160;

Director In dependence 

The Board periodically assesses, with the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the independence of its non-employee members as defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ and applicable laws. The Board undertook an analysis for each non-employee director and considered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the director&#8217;s other commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial relationships. The Board determined that with respect to each of its current members other than Elon Musk, who is our Chief Executive Officer, and Kimbal Musk, who is Elon Musk&#8217;s brother, there are no disqualifying factors with respect to director independence enumerated in the listing standards of NASDAQ or any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, and that each such member is an &#8220;independent director&#8221; as defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ and applicable laws. 

In particular, the Board reviewed the following considerations:

&#160;

&#8226; 

Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias (prior to his departure from the Board in October 2021), James Murdoch, Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have made minority investments in certain companies or investment funds (i) of which other Tesla directors are founders, significant stockholders, directors, officers, or managers, and/or (ii) with which Tesla has had certain relationships, such as those set forth in &#8220; Related Party Transactions &#8221; under this Item 13 above. The Board concluded that none of these investments are material so as to impede the exercise of independent judgment by any of Messrs. Ehrenpreis, Gracias or Mr. Murdoch, and that none of them has a direct or indirect interest in any transaction between Tesla and another company such as those set forth in &#8220; Related Party Transactions &#8221; under this Item 13 above. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Mr. Gracias is a director of SpaceX, (i) of which Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk are also directors, and (ii) with which Tesla has had certain relationships, such as those set forth in &#8220; Related Party Transactions&#8212;SpaceX &#8221; under this Item 13 above. The Board concluded that Mr. Gracias is an experienced investment professional who has served on the boards of multiple companies without conflict or impairment of independent judgment. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Lawrence J. Ellison, and/or entities affiliated with him, have purchased certain Tesla products and services from Tesla. The Board concluded that such purchases were negotiated and completed through ordinary course sales processes in good faith on terms generally available to similar customers, and would not impair the independent judgment of Mr. Ellison. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Mr. Ellison is an officer of a company from which Tesla has purchased business services. The Board concluded that such purchases were for standard offerings in the ordinary course of business pursuant to good faith contracting processes in which Mr. Ellison was neither involved nor had any material interest. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

As previously disclosed by Tesla, Elon Musk had previously agreed to provide certain directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; indemnity coverage to us from his personal funds, which the Board concluded did not impair the independent judgment of the other members of the Board.
