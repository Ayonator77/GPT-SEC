On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of its terms, which was subsequently approved by the Court. Mr. Musk did not admit or deny any of the SEC&#8217;s allegations, and there is no restriction on Mr. Musk&#8217;s ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board (other than as its Chair for a specified time).
