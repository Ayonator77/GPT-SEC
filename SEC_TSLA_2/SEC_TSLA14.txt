Under this policy, the Audit Committee must pre- approve all services and associated fees provided to Tesla by its independent registered public accounting firm, with certain de minimis exceptions described in the policy.

All PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP services and fees in fiscal 2020 and 2021 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
