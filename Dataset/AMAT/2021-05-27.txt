Applied is exposed to interest rate risk through its investment portfolio and debt issuances, with fixed-income securities valued at approximately $1.8 billion as of May 2, 2021. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates could lead to a $26 million decrease in the fair value of the portfolio. However, if the securities are not sold before recovery, the losses are not realized on the consolidated statement of operations. On the other hand, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates could result in an increase of approximately $723 million in the fair value of Applied's long-term senior notes issuances. Additionally, Applied uses currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, which helps to mitigate risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These financial instruments are not utilized for trading or speculative purposes.
