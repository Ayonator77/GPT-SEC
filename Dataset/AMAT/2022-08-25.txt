Applied is exposed to financial market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As of July 31, 2022, the market value of the company's investments in available-for-sale securities was approximately $1.9 billion. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a decrease in the fair value of investments by about $24 million. Also, Applied has $5.5 billion in long-term senior unsecured notes, and a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would increase the fair value of these notes by approximately $563 million. The company uses hedging strategies, such as foreign currency forward contracts, to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on financial statements. These strategies are used primarily for risk management and not for trading or speculative purposes.

(Brief summary: Applied faces market risks from interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, mitigated by hedging strategies, including foreign currency forwards. The company's investments and long-term notes are affected by interest rate changes, with potential gains or losses. Hedging contracts help manage the impact of currency movements on financial statements, with no speculative use of foreign currency contracts.)
