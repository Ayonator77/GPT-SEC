The text provides information on market risk disclosures related to interest rates and foreign currency risk for the company. The company's exposure to market risks has not significantly changed since December 31, 2019. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar make up 54% of the total amount, leading to foreign currency risk. Fluctuations in exchange rates can impact revenue and operating income negatively when expressed in U.S. dollars. The company experienced a significant foreign exchange loss in the nine months ending September 30, 2020, primarily due to remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities not in functional currency. The company does not currently use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge currency exposures, and exchange rate fluctuations pose a potential risk to future operational results due to international expansion.
