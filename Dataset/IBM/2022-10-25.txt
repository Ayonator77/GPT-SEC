The text provides a comprehensive overview of the financial results and operational changes of a company for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2022. The company has implemented organizational changes, including the separation of a managed infrastructure services unit and a realignment of management structure. Significant transactions such as the purchase of annuity contracts have also occurred. The company defines and measures hybrid cloud revenue and presents non-GAAP measures like operating earnings to offer clarity on operational performance. While revenue growth was observed in North America, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, factors like a one-time pension settlement charge impacted total expenses and other income. The text also highlights macroeconomic factors such as labor and component costs, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company is actively taking measures to mitigate the impact of these factors on its financial performance, despite slight increases in expenses such as selling, general, and administrative expenses during the third quarter driven by higher spending and credit loss provisions. Research, development, and engineering expenses remained relatively stable throughout the quarter and nine-month periods.
