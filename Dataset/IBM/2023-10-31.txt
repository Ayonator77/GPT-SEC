IBM underwent several financial changes in 2022 and 2023, including purchasing annuity contracts to transfer pension obligations to insurers, resulting in a $5.9 billion settlement charge in Q3 2022. Changes in accounting estimates for equipment useful lives increased income in 2023. Workforce rebalancing actions led to charges, and currency adjustments were implemented for financial results to enhance comparability. Non-GAAP earnings exclude specific charges for transparency. The company achieved revenue growth, profit margin expansion, and strong cash generation in Q3 2023, driven by growth in Software and Consulting. Net income, earnings per share, and operating income improved significantly compared to the previous year, reflecting better performance and cost management strategies.

The financial report discusses revenue increases across regions, such as the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, with currency adjustments. It includes a decline in total expenses and other income compared to the prior year due to non-operating adjustments, scrutinizing various expense categories and income sources to evaluate the company's financial status.
