There were no significant changes in internal control over financial reporting identified during the evaluated period. Management acknowledges that controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance due to resource constraints and the need for judgment in their evaluation and implementation.

The text discusses various risk factors that could adversely affect the business operations, financial condition, and results of operations of the company. These risks include challenges related to product offerings, business operations, financial results, government regulations and enforcement, data security and intellectual property, ownership of Class A Common Stock, interruptions in product availability or performance due to technical infrastructure issues, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and cyber-attacks. Challenges also include difficulties in retaining and engaging users, changes in user data practices affecting ad targeting effectiveness, reductions in marketer spending, and impact from government regulations such as GDPR. The text also highlights potential difficulties in accurately measuring user engagement metrics, potential inaccuracies in user data, and challenges related to managing growth while maintaining corporate culture and adapting to remote work.
