      "810&#8221;), we consolidate any variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) of which we are the\n",
      "primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of\n",
      "business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with\n",
      "solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for\n",
      "a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an\n",
      "entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through\n",
      "arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest\n",
      "holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that\n",
      "most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses\n",
      "of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from\n",
      "the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we\n",
      "have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have\n",
      "determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16 , Variable Interest\n",
      "Entity Arrangements ). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure\n",
