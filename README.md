# GPT-SEC
The goal of this project is to use natural language processing with OpenAI’s latest models in order to find, process, and interpret SEC filings, both historically and real-time, so as to be able to predict market sentiment and reactions to those filings before they have a broader impact on the relevant stock’s price.  

The project will be considered complete in the following cases: 

A predictive model is created which, on back-tested data and on forward-tested data, outperforms the S&P by any amount;  

or it is definitively shown that no model or algorithm will be able to outperform the S&P by any amount.
